# chess_in_review

## Description:

Hello, this is a very bad project I made for school called Chessinreview. Chessinreview is a web application built on Django that provides statistics for chess.com users. It retrieves data from the chess.com API to display information such as ratings in blitz, rapid, and bullet formats, win/loss/draw ratios, account creation date, and country of residence. Additionally, it showcases the user's top 5 most played openings.

## Installation 
So just download the code or do git clone, do pip install -r requirments.txt to install the requirments (there are probably a few that you don't need since I didn't use a venv), and then run python manage.py runserver, click the link and there you have it.
